# 137. Clone Graph



#### Description

中文English

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a `label` and a list of its `neighbors`.

How we serialize an undirected graph:[http://www.lintcode.com/help/graph/](http://www.lintcode.com/help/graph/)

Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use `#` as a separator for each node, and `,` as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph `{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}`.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by `#`.

1. First node is labeled as `0`. Connect node `0` to both nodes `1` and `2`.
2. Second node is labeled as `1`. Connect node `1` to node `2`.
3. Third node is labeled as `2`. Connect node `2` to node `2` \(itself\), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:

```text
   1
  / \
 /   \
0 --- 2
     / \
     \_/
     
     
```

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for undirected graph.
 * struct UndirectedGraphNode {
 *     int label;
 *     vector<UndirectedGraphNode *> neighbors;
 *     UndirectedGraphNode(int x) : label(x) {};
 * };
 */


class Solution {
public:
    /*
     * @param node: A undirected graph node
     * @return: A undirected graph node
     */
    UndirectedGraphNode* cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode* node) {
        if (!node) return nullptr;
        
        map<UndirectedGraphNode*,UndirectedGraphNode*> m;
        std::queue<UndirectedGraphNode*> q;
        q.push(node);
        UndirectedGraphNode* first = nullptr;
        
        while(!q.empty()){
            UndirectedGraphNode* e = q.front(); q.pop();
            UndirectedGraphNode* newE = nullptr;
            if (m.find(e) == m.end()){
                newE = new UndirectedGraphNode(e->label);
                m[e] = newE;
            }else{
                newE = m[e];
            }
            
            if (first == nullptr){
                first = newE;
            }
            
            for(auto v : e->neighbors){
                if (m.find(v) == m.end()){
                        UndirectedGraphNode* cur = new UndirectedGraphNode(v->label);
                        m[v] = cur;     
                        q.push(v);
                        newE->neighbors.push_back(cur);
                }else{
                    newE->neighbors.push_back(m[v]);   
                }
            }
        }
        return first;
    }
};
