# 611 Knight Shortest Path

**Description**  
Given a knight in a chessboard \(a binary matrix with 0 as empty and 1 as barrier\) with a source position, find the shortest path to a destinationposition, return the length of the route.  
Return -1 if knight can not reached.  
  
**Notice**  
source and destination must be empty.  
Knight can not enter the barrier.  
  
  
**Clarification**  
If the knight is at \(x, y\), he can get to the following positions in one step:  
  
\(x + 1, y + 2\)  
\(x + 1, y - 2\)  
\(x - 1, y + 2\)  
\(x - 1, y - 2\)  
\(x + 2, y + 1\)  
\(x + 2, y - 1\)  
\(x - 2, y + 1\)  
\(x - 2, y - 1\)  
  
  
**Example**  
\[\[0,0,0\],  
 \[0,0,0\],  
 \[0,0,0\]\]  
source = \[2, 0\] `destination` = \[2, 2\] return 2  
  
\[\[0,1,0\],  
 \[0,0,0\],  
 \[0,0,0\]\]  
source = \[2, 0\] destination = \[2, 2\] return 6  
  
\[\[0,1,0\],  
 \[0,0,1\],  
 \[0,0,0\]\]  
source = \[2, 0\] destination = \[2, 2\] return -1
