* lintcode 5 Kth Largest Element
* lintcode 606 Kth Largest Element II
* lintcode 461 Kth Smallest Numbers in Unsorted Array
* **Description** Find the kth smallest numbers in an unsorted integer array.   **Example** Given \[3, 4, 1, 2, 5\], k = 3, the 3rd smallest numbers are \[1, 2, 3\].  **Challenge**  An O\(nlogn\) algorithm is acceptable, if you can do it in O\(n\), that would be great.
