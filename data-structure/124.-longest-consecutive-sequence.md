# 124. Longest Consecutive Sequence



#### Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.Have you met this question in a real interview?  YesProblem Correction

#### Clarification

Your algorithm should run in O\(n\) complexity.

#### Example

Given `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`,  
The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Return its length: `4`.

solution:

1 use the 'set' to store all the elements, iterate number from the first element, find all its all consecutive numbers, if find the consecutive element, remove it from set.



```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param num: A list of integers
     * @return: An integer
     */
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int> &num) {
        // write your code here
        unordered_set<int> s(num.begin(),num.end());
        int res = 0;
        
        for(auto v : num){
            if (s.find(v) != s.end()){
                int prev = v - 1;
                int next = v + 1;
                
                while(s.find(prev) != s.end()){
                    s.erase(prev);
                    prev--;
                }
                
                while(s.find(next) != s.end()){
                    s.erase(next);
                    next++;
                }
                res = max(res,next -prev - 1);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
