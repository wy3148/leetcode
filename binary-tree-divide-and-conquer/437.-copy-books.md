# 437. Copy Books

Given _n_ books and the _i_th book has `A[i]` pages. You are given _k_ people to copy the _n_books.

_n_ books list in a row and each person can claim a continous range of the _n_ books. For example one copier can copy the books from _i_th to _j_th continously, but he can not copy the 1st book, 2nd book and 4th book \(without 3rd book\).

They start copying books at the same time and they all cost 1 minute to copy 1 page of a book. What's the best strategy to assign books so that the slowest copier can finish at earliest time?Have you met this question in a real interview?  YesProblem Correction
