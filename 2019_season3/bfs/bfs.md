# Simple notes

bfs algorithm, classic problems,

1. island, number of islands

2 maze problems

3 graph clone, binary tree convertion to graph

4 shortest path to all nodes

course scheduler I II. 拓扑排序

Is Graph Bipartite

cheapest K stops [https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/description/)

And etc

we need to understand how to build a graph from a tree or some array information

1. most of time, we can use Queue data structuer

Dikara distance may not use Queue

1. sometime we need to think about if we search 'by level' or no.

//but technically , we can always search by level.

1. sometime we probably need 'visited' data structure which can be hashmap or 2D

   array to store thoese visited nodes.
