# 75. Find Peak Element

#### Description

There is an integer array which has the following features:

* The numbers in adjacent positions are different.
* A\[0\] &lt; A\[1\] && A\[A.length - 2\] &gt; A\[A.length - 1\].

We define a position P is a peak if:

```text
A[P] > A[P-1] && A[P] > A[P+1]
```

Find a peak element in this array. Return the index of the peak.

* It's guaranteed the array has at least one peak.
* The array may contain multiple peeks, find any of them.
* The array has at least 3 numbers in it.

#### Example

```text
Example 1:
	Input:  [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6]
	Output:  1 or 6
	
	Explanation:
	return the index of peek.


Example 2:
	Input: [1,2,3,4,1]
	Output:  3

```

#### Challenge

Time complexity O\(logN\)

Notes:

we still use the binary search, when we find the middle element meets the requirement, it returns, otherwise, if mid &lt; mid -1 ; it means on the left right of the middle position,  there must be a peak element there.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param A: An integers array.
     * @return: return any of peek positions.
     */
    int findPeak(vector<int> &A) {
        // write your code here
        
        if (A.size() == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        
        int start = 0;
        int end = A.size() -1;
        
        while( start + 1 < end){
            int mid = (start + end)/2;
            if (A[mid] > A[mid - 1] &&
            A[mid] > A[mid + 1]){
                return mid;
            }else if (A[mid] < A[mid - 1]){
                end = mid;
            }else{
                start = mid;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```
